APCS Final Project- Least-Squares Regression

By Alan Yang & Vikram Anjur

This project will perform Least-Squares Linear Regression by fitting a line to a text file of data points. 
The output of this code will show: 

1. The chi squared value and equation of the line
2. A graph of the curve (in 2D, default xy plane)
